EV Watts Public Dataset Data Dictionary

The EV WATTS public dataset adheres to the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) protocol 
definitions of station, EVSE, port, and connector. EVSE is described as a single unit of 
Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE) reporting data from a number of connectors from the 
unit. The number of ports is a count of the connectors that can be simultaneously activated 
while connectors are described as individual cord sets that could be plugged into a vehicle. 
More information can be found at https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html 
under Charging Station Terminology.

PK = primary key
FK = foreign key

evse table

session table
    session_id - PK - an identifier that is artificially generated to represent a unique charging session
    evse_id - FK to the EVSE table, represents the EVSE where the session is being completed
    connector_id - FK to connector table represents which unique port is being used
    start_datetime - session start date and time
    end_datetime - session charge end date and time
    total_duration - the amount of time between start_datetime and end_datetime (in hours)
    charge_duration - the amount of time that energy was provided from the EVSE to the vehicle (in hours)
    energy_kwh - amount of energy provided (in kWh)
    charge_level - records which level of charging is being used for that session (L2, DCFC)
    start_soc - % of battery capacity  at the start of the session (only available for DCFC)
    end_soc - % of battery capacity at the end of session (only available for DCFC)
    flag_id - FK to PK id in flag table, denotes an error with the session (refer to flag table)


NOTE: The combined_session table contains information from the connector, evse, and session table above, and combined into a single table. 
The combined_session table can be used without any of the other tables

FLAGS used for marking issues with sessions

Error Flags are provided to allow users to see charging sessions that are erroneous in nature, the 
error flags follow a boolean logic scheme in a binary number where a one in a certain 
digit's place indicates a particular error
